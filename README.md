# Cyber-attack-classification-Using-Network-Traffic-Data


## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **detecting and classifying cyberattacks** using **network traffic data**. We utilize **ML and DL models** to analyze network packets and identify malicious activity. The dataset used is **NSL-KDD**, a widely used benchmark for intrusion detection systems (IDS).  

##  Dataset: NSL-KDD  
We use the **NSL-KDD dataset**, which consists of normal and attack traffic data with 41 extracted features. The dataset is preprocessed and converted into a structured format for training and evaluation.

-  **Training Data:** `KDDTrain+.txt`  
  
-  **Classes:** Normal Traffic (`0`), Attack Traffic (`1`)  

##  Model Implementations  
The project compares various **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models** to evaluate their performance.  

###  **Implemented Models**  
### ** Machine Learning Models**  
 **Logistic Regression**  
**Decision Tree Classifier**  
**Random Forest Classifier**  
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
**Ensemble Voting Classifier** (Soft & Hard Voting)  

## Evaluation Metrics  
To assess model performance, we use:  
**Accuracy**  
**Precision**  
**Recall (Sensitivity)**  
**F1-Score**  
**Confusion Matrix**  
**ROC-AUC Curve**
